        <h4 class="text-primary mt-5" style="margin-left:15%;">What Are Dental Implants?</h4>
            <p class="text-justify text-dark mt-4" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;text-align:justify;">A dental implant replaces a missing tooth. It can also work to support dentures if the dentist feels that is the most appropriate solution. The implant itself is a small post made of titanium that is surgically implanted below the gum line into the jawbone. Titanium is the metal used in many prosthetics and artificial joints. The implant will fuse with the jawbone over time, and become a permanent fixture in your mouth.
            <br><br>
            Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth, serving as an option to traditional procedures such as dental bridges and dentures. The implant is made from a titanium post that’s embedded in the jawbone. It replaces the root of the original tooth, and it securely anchors the new tooth. A specially shaped piece of metal, the abutment, is fastened to the top of the implant, then the new tooth is attached to the abutment.
            <br><br>

          <h4 style="margin-left:15%;" class="text-primary mt-5">How Do Dental Implants Work?</h4>
              <p class="text-justify text-dark mt-4" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;text-align:justify;">Every case must be properly assessed to ensure that the results are the best they can be for each patient. Every patient is different, from their existing dental and medical situation to their wants and needs from the procedure. Good dentistry means taking everything into account, from the aesthetic to the functional, to create dental implant solutions that will look great, feel comfortable, and work just like real teeth. 
                <br><br>
                Sometimes, it takes understanding what went wrong in the first place with the natural teeth to get it right with implants. When planning out the process, factors such as time and financial constraints should be considered, to ensure that patient expectations are managed. There are several treatment options, and they all carry their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. Once everything is fully considered and evaluated, we will present you with a treatment plan for your approval.

                <h4 style="margin-left:15%;" class="text-primary mt-5">What Is Recovery Like After Dental Implant Surgery?</h4>
                <p class="text-justify text-dark mt-4" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;text-align:justify;">
                    Recovery from dental implant surgery will often depend on many factors. However, when dental implants have been surgically installed, it is important to maintain thorough oral hygiene behaviors to ensure that the bone fuses properly without interruption. Failure to care for oral health is the foremost cause of the failure of dental implants.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, infection of the implant site and surrounding areas may occur if they are not properly cleaned and cared for. Discomfort is expected to be minimal following your initial dental implant procedure. Slight bruising or bleeding near the dental implants may occur. Some swelling of the gums as well as the face is normal and expected. Your dentist may prescribe pain medication to help alleviate any aches or pain you may experience as a result of your dental implants procedure.
                    <br><br>
                    Follow up appointments with your dental professional is imperative to a successful implant. Your dentist can ensure that any problems are quickly and effectively addressed. Properly caring for your dental implants is important to make sure that they last as long as possible.

                            <li style="margin-right:15%;">They Prevent Bone Loss<br><br>The loss of a tooth and triggers a chain of reactions within the mouth, some of which result in the loss of bone mass around the site of the missing tooth. Ideally, the root of a tooth doesn’t just support it and hold it into position, it also plays a key role in strengthening the jaw bone in a process referred to as ossification. With a missing tooth, the process dies down and begins to lose strength. One of the advantages of dental implants is that they help rekindle it thus boosting the strength and preventing further muscle loss of bone mass.
                            </li>  <br><br>
                            <li style="margin-right:15%;">They Support Facial Structures <br><br>The jaws and strong healthy teeth by far play a pivotal role in supporting other facial structures. The fact that they are strategically located at the base of face implies that they are closely intertwined with several other facial muscles. In this case, missing teeth and shrinking jaws affect the rest of the face. If not addressed in time, you stand to suffer a sunken face and exaggerated signs of premature aging. These can be, nonetheless, reversed by dental implants.
                            </li>   <br><br>
                            <li style="margin-right:15%;">They Boost Your Self-esteem<br><br>The smile is often considered the best of a piece of garment anyone put on. Missing teeth and shrinking gums tend to affect your smile and this eats your self-esteem. The dental implants information for patients holds that the situation is even worse if an individual loses the frontal teeth. Dental implants, however, play contributory roles in helping a patient regain their confidence and esteem by helping reshape the once perfect smile.
                            </li>   <br><br>
                            <li style="margin-right:15%;">They Limit What You Eat<br><br>The bite strength and ability to chew often determine what you eat. What happens when you don’t have one or both frontal teeth or the molars? You will either have trouble biting into your favorite food or unable to comfortably chew them. Either case forces you to be picky with what you eat while ensuring that you forego some of your favorites altogether. One of the benefits of dental implants is that they are as strong as the original teeth and that by filling these dental gaps, you get to continue with your normal life and enjoying all your favorite meals.
                            </li>  <br><br>
                             <li style="margin-right:15%;">They offer a permanent solution to dental gaps<br><br>Why dental implants and not the other types of dental problem correctional processes as dentures you may ask? Because implants offer a permanent solution to the missing teeth problem. Unlike the removable dentures, dental implants are permanently affixed into the base of the jaw. You, therefore, don’t have to worry about them falling off or having to replace them every now and then.
